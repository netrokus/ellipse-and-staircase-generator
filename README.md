## üéÆ How to Use

### 2D Mode (Default)
1. **Set Dimensions**: Adjust outer and inner ellipse width/height
2. **Configure Spokes**: Set spoke count and navigate through individual spokes
3. **Toggle Fill Steps**: Enable to create solid wedge-shaped steps instead of single lines
4. **Choose Display**: Select fit mode (window, width, or height)
5. **Interact**: 
   - Left-click + drag to select areas
   - Right-click + drag to pan
   - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out

### 3D Mode
1. **Click "2D Mode" button** in the header to switch to 3D visualization
2. **Set Staircase Parameters**:
   - Choose direction (upward or downward spiral)
   - Adjust step height
   - Set starting spoke position
3. **View Modes**:
   - **Show All Steps**: View the complete spiral staircase
   - **Show Single Step**: Build the staircase incrementally using Previous/Next buttons
4. **Navigate**:
   - Drag to rotate the camera around the staircase
   - Shift + drag to pan the camera
   - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
   - **WASD** or **Arrow keys** to move the camera
   - **Q/E** to move up/down

## üõ†Ô∏è Controls

### Ellipse Controls
- **Width/Height**: Set ellipse dimensions (3+ for outer, 1+ for inner)
- **Mirror Button**: üîó Link width/height for perfect circles
- **+/- Buttons**: Quick increment/decrement values

### Spoke Controls
- **Count**: Number of spokes (4-64)
- **Fill Steps**: Toggle between single-line spokes and solid wedge-shaped steps
- **Previous/Next**: Navigate through individual spokes (2D) or build incrementally (3D single step mode)

### 3D Staircase Controls (3D Mode Only)
- **View Mode**: Toggle between showing all steps or building incrementally
- **Direction**: Choose upward or downward spiral
- **Step Height**: Control the vertical distance between each step (0.5-5 blocks)
- **Start Spoke**: Set which spoke the spiral begins from (visible in "Show All Steps" mode)

### Display Options (2D Mode Only)
- **Fit to Window**: Auto-scale to fit container
- **Fit Width**: Scale to container width
